This code is part of my diploma thesis entitled: "Autonomous battle tactiques generation for Real Time Strategy games using Neuroevolution"

This project was implemented in VS2008, using VC++. The goal was to take advantage of the rtNEAT algorithm created by Kenneth O. Stanley in order to control low-level soldiers in the RTS game StarCraft Broodwar. 

This repository contains the code written by myself. For a fully functional code the BWAPI 3.7.2 library is needed allong with the rtNEAT source code.
